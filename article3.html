		<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px;">Neil Armstrong was my third cousin and is the most trustworthy individual I know. I spoke to him a few months after the “moon landing”. I asked him if the moon landing was staged. He told me it indeed was staged…that NASA didn’t have the proper equipment to safely allow astronauts to go to the moon and back to earth. They did indeed want to send them to the moon but they couldn’t risk losing people. They were told that they had a plan to make it look like they actually went to the moon. The plan worked well and most people believed it. Neil was told to keep quiet, but he felt it was wrong. Neil stated, “Just know that people have never been to the moon and millions of Americans will believe people have gone for years to come.” This has to be true as I know Neil very well. Such an honest man who only wanted people to know the truth!</p>
