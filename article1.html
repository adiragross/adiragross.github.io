		<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px;">I had a dream a few nights back where I was at the filming of the moon landing. I believe that I am a bit of a prophet so my dreams have to be true, you know what I mean. In the dream I asked the camera man why he was okay lying to the entire American public and his response was something crazy. He said get off the set... Why are you here... how did you get into this government facility? This is undeniable proof that there is no real moon landing. Later in that same dream it started smelling like really really bad cheese. I am really really lactose intolerant and that cheese smell started making me feel uncomfortable. I was in the same set as the falsified moon landing but this time no one else was there so I decided to do the only logical thing and take a bite of it. Wow it was so not yummy but I can 100% guarantee that it is made of cheese. Lactose intolerant people can recognize lactose about three minutes after the first bite. Never again will I look at the moon. </p>
