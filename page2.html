		<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px">Why are we doing this? Simple. We want the government to stop being so comfortable in its lies. Ever since this little "play" the government put on for everyone, they got too comfortable telling their citizens a multitude of lies. Not only do most US citizens believe the moon landing is real (brainwashed idiots) but they also believe the earth is round. This can't be allowed to happen. Every year, the citizens of the United States think they're getting smarter and smarter when in reality they have a severe case of government-mandated stockholm syndrome. Take a look at this real picture that NASA realeased of a spaceman. Does this look real to you?</p>

		<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px">That's what I thought. These "government employees", or as I like to call them, evil-doers, are spreading US propaganda into their own country and convincing their own 30 IQ citizens that they understand anything about the world and how it works. These people do not deserve to be on US soil if they are going to spread propaganda to their own citizens and children when they grow up. This is pure evil.</p>
