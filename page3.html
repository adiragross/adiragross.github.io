		<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px">Where did this happen? I'll tell you where. Not on the moon. Clearly this is the work of Hollywood. You can see the stagelights if you look hard enough. Notice how there's no stars in the sky? That's because this is not in space. You can't fake stars. This was clearly done on a movie set, set up to look like the real moon. But we all know. We know the truth. You can't lie to us. Marvel does things 100x more impressive than this. Also, notice the video quality. Ever notice how all videos with aliens in it are fake and all have low quality cameras? Why couldn't NASA just afford a Canon 80D for this space adventure? Hmm? Exactly. Just what I thought. Ever think about who else was there to shoot the footage as well? How could he be the first man on the moon if someone else was there with the camera? That's what I thought. Here is a good video detailing how nobody knows about the moon landing or who shot it.</p>
