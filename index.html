	<p style="color:white;padding-right:300px;padding-left:300px">My name is Adira Gross. I am onto the government and their attempts to fool the United States and its people. We know. We are enlightened. We are free of your lies. You believe your people to be unintelligent, a bunch of TV-watching peasants with nothing better to do in our days like question the morals and ethics of their beloved government. But not everyone is blind to your methods of mind control. Blatantly lying to your citizens, having them believe we touched the moon first. Much like the highly acclaimed movie, "The Matrix" starring Keanu Reeves, I am awakened. I am enlightened. As are my followers. We are not blind to your cruel mind control. This page will serve to show any of those curious about their governments lies that they are not alone. We will grow in numbers daily. You can not stop us. We know the truth. Please browse our site to understand our beliefs.</p>
