Stop being okay with it guys and wake up. We can only wake up if we dismantle the patriarchy. Only once men no longer exist will we find salvation. Also can we take a moment to acknowledge how awesome this website is. Back to preaching... How do I know that we are really in Area 51? Well that is a good question to start out there are 50 states plus the capital which brings us to 51 so in the US it is 100% area 51 because there are 51 areas. A bit more of a reach is that if you look up at exactly 12:51 am (00:51 in military time) you can see the stars laughing at you because they are really just lights that the patriarchy established. WE MUST GET SALVATION. Everything will be explained on December 21st 2012 when the time comes for the patriarchy to turn off the lights in the "sky" and for this "world" as we know it to end. I am going to be selling a book with all of the thoughts the government is trying to hide from us for only $72.00. Guys don't get me started on money it's just a social construct and you should provide it to me so I can make a live video of burning as much of it as possible.</p>
